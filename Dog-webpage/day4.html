    <h2> Description </h2>
    <p> The Siberian Husky possesses a compact, muscular frame built for endurance and speed. <br> Their double coat
        consists of a dense undercoat for insulation and a longer outer coat that repels moisture and snow. <br> Coat
        colors range widely—common variations include black and white, red and white, gray and white, solid white, and
        agouti. Many have distinctive mask-like facial markings and dark outlines around their eyes, giving them a
        “wolf-like” appearance.<br> Despite their rugged build, they move with surprising grace and efficiency,
        reflecting their heritage as long-distance runners.<br> They have a powerful gait, and their feet are uniquely
        adapted to grip snow, aiding traction and speed on icy terrain.</p>

    <br>

    <h2>Origins</h2>
    <p>The Siberian Husky’s roots trace back thousands of years to the Chukchi people of Siberia, a nomadic tribe who
        relied on these dogs for survival in one of the harshest environments on Earth.<br> The dogs were bred not only
        for pulling sleds over vast frozen landscapes but also for companionship and warmth.<br> In 1908, Huskies were
        brought to Alaska for sled dog racing and quickly earned a reputation for their unmatched endurance and
        resilience.<br> Their fame spread after the 1925 serum run to Nome, where a team of Siberian Huskies, led by the
        legendary dog Balto, helped deliver diphtheria antitoxin across treacherous terrain, saving countless lives.</p>

    <br>


    <h2>Temperament</h2>
    <p>Siberian Huskies are friendly, alert, and free-spirited dogs that thrive on human interaction and social
        environments.<br> Unlike some other working breeds, Huskies are typically not aggressive or territorial, which
        can make them less effective as guard dogs but excellent companions.<br> They are pack-oriented and usually get
        along well with other dogs, but their strong prey drive can make them unsuitable to live with small animals such
        as rabbits or birds.<br> They are intelligent and curious but can be willful or stubborn—making consistent
        training and patience essential.<br> Because of their high energy and independence, they are best suited to
        experienced dog owners who can meet their mental and physical needs.</p>

    <br>

    <h2>Health</h2>
    <p>Siberian Huskies are generally considered a healthy breed, with a relatively long lifespan of 12–15 years.<br>
        However, they are prone to a few hereditary conditions.<br> Common health issues include hip dysplasia, which
        can affect mobility; eye conditions such as cataracts, corneal dystrophy, and progressive retinal atrophy (PRA);
        and hypothyroidism, a hormonal disorder that can lead to lethargy and weight gain.<br> Their thick coats make
        them more comfortable in colder climates, and they can be prone to overheating in hot weather.<br> Regular
        exercise, high-quality nutrition, and routine veterinary checkups can help maintain their health throughout
        their lives.</p>

    <br>

    <h2> Appearance Around the World</h2>
    <p>While the Siberian Husky remains most closely associated with snowy, Arctic landscapes, their popularity has
        grown globally due to their beauty and engaging temperament. <br> In North America and Europe, they are commonly
        seen as family pets, working dogs, and even in canine sports like skijoring, bikejoring, and sled racing. <br>
        In colder countries like Canada, Norway, and Russia, they continue to thrive in traditional roles. <br> In
        warmer climates, such as parts of South America or the Middle East, their coats can be a challenge, but with
        proper care and shelter, they adapt well. <br> Around the world, their wolf-like appearance, loyal nature, and
        adventurous spirit make them a beloved breed across diverse cultures and environments. </p>
